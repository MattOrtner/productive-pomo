High-level Goal: The app should be a combination of a pomodoro timer and a todo list. The user should be able create two running to-do lists.
One primary list is the current task at hand, the secondary list is the list of activities that they want to do during their
alloted break time. The goal of the app is to encourage the user to use the break time to re-energize themselves by focusing
on either physical body activites (different stretches, lunges, push-ups, healthy snack), mental activities (breathing exercises,
cleaning their space, taking out the trash, calling a friend, calling a loved one). The app allows them to create these two lists,
and manage them as they complete each activity.

Core features: landing, login, register, timer, two different editable lists

Tech Stack: React, ReactRouter, Node/Express, PostgreSQL

Design/UX notes: blue, green, orange, moroon. Relaxed vibe. Keyboard shortcuts for jumping between activities
